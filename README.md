# algezebra

what's an Algezebra ? 
Nobody exactly know.. Perhaps a zebra implementing operator like | or || or ...

famous algorithm in abstract algebra with cats and Algebird

## Why create something like that ?

### Mono.. what ?

I think practical approach facilitate the understanding behind abstract algebra like monoid, monad, functor.

### Easy to use
 But in other hand to experiment around algorithm.
I think it's also a good way to demonstrate how using monoid allow to have generic interface for the algorithm. 
Facilitating the use of these structures.
