# algebra
famous algorithm in abstract algebra with cats and Algebird

## List of algorithms
### Sketch

* AMS 
* Frequent (What's hot and what's not)
* Entropy sketch 

### Filter

* Cuckoo Filter

## Why create something like that ?

First to learn something from monoid and functional programming. But in other hand to experiment around algorithm.
I think it's also a good way to demonstrate how using monoid allow to have generic interface for the algorithm. 
Facilitating the use of these structures.
